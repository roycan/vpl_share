# VPL Guide Website - Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS Version

This is a simplified version of the VPL guide website created with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed as a teaching tool for high school students learning web development basics.

## Structure

The project consists of three main files:

1. **index.html** - The HTML structure of the website
2. **styles.css** - All styling for the website
3. **script.js** - JavaScript functionality

## Features

This version includes:

- Responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop
- Interactive elements (tabs, accordion, copy buttons)
- Navigation with scrollspy functionality
- Mobile menu for smaller screens

## Learning Opportunities

This codebase provides excellent teaching examples for:

### HTML
- Semantic HTML5 elements (header, footer, section, nav)
- Form elements
- Accessibility attributes
- Document structure

### CSS
- CSS variables (custom properties)
- Flexbox and CSS Grid layouts
- Media queries for responsive design
- Transitions and animations
- Mobile-first approach

### JavaScript
- DOM manipulation
- Event listeners
- Conditional logic
- Timing functions
- Clipboard API

## Using for Teaching

When teaching with this codebase, consider:

1. Walking through each file separately to explain its purpose
2. Highlighting the connections between HTML elements, CSS selectors, and JavaScript
3. Challenging students to make modifications or additions
4. Breaking down more complex features (like the tabs or accordion) step by step

## Local Setup

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the site. No build process or server is required.

## Extension Ideas for Students

- Add a dark mode toggle
- Create additional content sections
- Implement form validation
- Add more interactive elements
- Create animations for page transitions
